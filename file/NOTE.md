# What is this?
Used to store some lua dependent files.
For download

# Why create a folder for the dependent files?
In order not to make this repository more confusing, it is a good choice to create a separate folder.

# Why are some files not in the folder?
Make sure some files download link is no change and available. Because these files is for older lua, and i dont want to edit it. So that is this. :3
