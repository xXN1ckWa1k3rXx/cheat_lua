In order to give me more thoughtful coding and let you know my purpose, these are the features I added initially (for the first time) on Elysia
As stated in README.MD, the price does not exceed 1.25 nle, and the minimum is Free 
the chance of Free is very small, it depends on the final result and will not be open source [only open source paid branches if I can't fix it]

The final result depends on my technical bottleneck

     - Hitchance Modifiers
     - Jumpscout
     - Force teleport
      - Only Head/SP/Baim
      - Only Head Override Mode
     - Any more..?

           - Fake Flick
           - Random jitter rate

     - Presets (very stupid)
