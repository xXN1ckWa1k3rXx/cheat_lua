# Roadmap
## Preface
Hi, i'm here. I know I haven't released any improvements or updates to Better NL and Elysia this month, that's because im was coding a new project about new script its called [Seteria](https://en.neverlose.cc/market/item?id=V4HYKQ), I will explain later whether this new script conflicts with [Elysia.lua](https://en.neverlose.cc/market/item?id=ghvUp6).

I have been busy with Coding Seteria this month, but due to personal academic problems, I am unable to get more free time and energy to invest in the Neverlose community. Not only that, I also don’t have a lot of time in Coding Seteria.

## Time?
In fact, Elysia.lua is just a script originally built for Nixware, but with nixware's suck api, I have to consider moving to support Neverlose. Although [Elysia Pre-alpha](https://en.neverlose.cc/market/item?id=AwRAuu) only has Antiaim settings, it took me 10+ days to complete it because there were some strange and bad ideas during the period.

The development of Elysia release took about 20 days, but during these 20 days I was almost in a hurry because I was about to start school at that time. I didn’t even seriously deal with the details and performance issues, or optimization, so now I haven’t been able to solve Elysia’s performance issues.

And Now, I only spent about fifteen days coding Seteria, but it was almost Recoding (almost recoding). And it work better.

Now my NL For CSGO sub has expired. i only have for cs2 sub (23d), so

## What is Next?
For Elysia.lua, unless For cs2 will take a long time to be released, we will not consider updating it for the time being. Please consider using Seteria, sorry.

Seteria still has a long way to go (including Elysia). i dont plan to give up on these two projects, as well as Better Neverlose.

## What is between Elysia.lua and Seteria?
There are many differences, Seteria is recoded, but there is no Elysia src in it. I don't intend to treat Elysia and Seteria as the same Script.
