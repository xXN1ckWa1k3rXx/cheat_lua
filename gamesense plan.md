I take back what I said before, CSGO is still available (Valve didn't mess it up, but I don't think they made it worse or patched them)

So I decided to make Better GameSense.

F. estk's cheat so sucks, so I need more time to make more features.

Must have

    - Conditions antiaim/fake lag
    - Defensive Antiaim
    - Air exploit
    - Aimbot logger
    - Cool visuals
    - and more, just give me some time to think

It may not be available in the release

    - Jitter correction

### Better GameSense will be loaded in the form of loader throughout the process
The reason is to keep it in an up-to-date state. And it won't like neverlose, u need to get the item again by urself
