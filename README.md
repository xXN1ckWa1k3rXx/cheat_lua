# xXYu3_zH3nGL1ngXx's scripts repository

# What is this?
Used to store my scripts.
The main purpose is to save the progress and facilitate the rollback version.

My coding skills are not very good, so sometimes the latest version is not as good as the earlier version.

**All scripts follow APACHE LICENSE 2 unless otherwise specified**
