# xXYu3_zH3nGL1ngXx's scripts repository

### An update is in progress
This update will change the repository directory to take advantage of git's version control features.

Due to the many changes, this will completely change the repository directory and the automatic update of better neverlose.



**Please re-pull the repository for updates after the official release of Better Neverlose 5.0**

EDITED: Market item has been hidden. The scripts in the repository are still available

Those issues will be fix in 5.0 version

5.0 Release on 2025 Q1 

### Please find other scripts to use instead of better nl

# What is this?
Used to store my scripts.
The main purpose is to save the progress and facilitate the rollback version.

My coding skills are not very good, so sometimes the latest version is not as good as the earlier version.

**All scripts follow APACHE LICENSE 2 unless otherwise specified**
