# xXYu3_zH3nGL1ngXx's scripts repository


### Updated Completely

This update changed the repository directory to take advantage of git's version control features.

Due to the many changes, this will completely change the repository directory and the automatic update of better neverlose.


# What is this?
Used to store my scripts.
The main purpose is to save the progress and facilitate the rollback version.

My coding skills are not very good, so sometimes the latest version is not as good as the earlier version.

**All scripts follow APACHE LICENSE 2 unless otherwise specified**
